// MARK: - ClickToRecordRecorder

/// Hosts a `KeyboardShortcuts.RecorderCocoa` and takes over its mouse handling.
///
/// Why: the package starts recording ONLY inside `RecorderCocoa.becomeFirstResponder()`
/// (RecorderCocoa.swift:206), which installs the `LocalEventMonitor` that captures the combo and
/// hides the caret via `hideCaret()` -> `currentEditor()?.insertionPointColor = .clear`
/// (Utilities.swift:28). On macOS 26, clicking the field can leave it looking and behaving like
/// a plain editable text field instead: the field editor activates with a visible caret and
/// mouse-selectable text (`currentEditor()` is not installed yet when `becomeFirstResponder()`
/// runs, so `hideCaret()` no-ops), and once the field editor is first responder a later click
/// never re-enters `becomeFirstResponder()`, so a recorder whose monitor died (e.g. after a
/// conflict alert blurred it) cannot be reactivated by clicking the text area; only the cancel
/// (x) button worked because `controlTextDidChange` calls `focus()`.
///
/// The fix: swallow every click except on the cancel button (via `hitTest`) and drive the
/// package's own activation path explicitly (`makeFirstResponder`), forcing a clean
/// resign-then-focus when a stale editing session is active. Caret hiding and text deselection
/// are re-applied on the next runloop tick (when the field editor is guaranteed to exist) every
/// time any recorder activates, keyboard-focused ones included.
